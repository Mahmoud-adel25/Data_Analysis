# Diabetes Data Analysis Using Python
# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and deriving insights from a diabetes dataset. The dataset includes medical and personal information about individuals, aiming to uncover relationships between variables and determine key predictors for diabetes.
Steps Involved

1. Data Analysis and Insights

Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.

Key relationships identified:

Age and Pregnancies (Strong Positive: r = 0.54)

Glucose and Diabetes Outcome (Moderate Positive: r = 0.47)

BMI and Diabetes Outcome (Moderate Positive: r = 0.29)

Data Visualization

Scatter plots, distribution plots, and boxplots for key variables such as BMI, Blood Pressure, and Skin Thickness.

Pie chart showing diabetes outcome distribution (imbalanced: 34.9% diabetic, 65.1% non-diabetic).

2. Statistical Analysis

Central Tendency

Calculations of mean, median, and mode for all variables.

Dispersion

Variance and standard deviation to understand data spread.

Outlier Analysis

Identification of extreme values in variables like Insulin, BMI, and Skin Thickness.

3. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handling missing or erroneous data (e.g., values of 0 for glucose, insulin, BMI).

Imputation strategies or exclusion of outliers.
# Dependencies
